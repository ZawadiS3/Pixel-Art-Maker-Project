# Pixel Art Maker Project
This is a pixel art maker project that I realized completing my Introduction to Javascript course with Udacity.

# Functionalities
- The user is able to define the size of the grid
- The user is able to choose a color for each specific cell
- The user is able to reset the grid

# Thanks!!
